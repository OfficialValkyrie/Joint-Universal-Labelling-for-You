# Joint Universal Labeling for You
aka JULY, is an organization provided for the soul purpose of a better unified scripting environment for our users.

## JULY has offically been created! ðŸŽ‰

Since UNC has retired, I've decided to step up as a member of the Exploiting Community and revive it to create a better environment for everyone in the community. Iâ€™ll be offering tutorials as time permits.

While I donâ€™t expect this to be as impactful as UNC, and balancing multiple projects might be challenging, I plan to keep this as a small-scale project for now.
JULY will receive monthly updates, as long as my schedule allows.
This project will include documentation on how to code functions and theoretical approaches, because I donâ€™t own every function in this language.

Feel free to explore JULY's files and create your own versions of JULY itself. I highly encourage you to develop your own theories and contributions.

## What Purpose does it behold?
I have seen people struggle and take others work as their own just to be in a higher stand then them. 
This is why, JULY has been created. Its purpose is to give people what they always wanted and needed the most. A better Eenvironment. 
Not everyone has the budget to access or get what they want. That's why, we, as a part of the exploiting community are free and nice. Our aim is to empower scripters by removing barriers to coding and simplifying the process of achieving compatibility across different platforms, not to take away that ability. With JULY's Joint Universal Labelling, we provide a solution that ensures scripts work seamlessly anywhere, making it easier to use, and easier to read.

With JULY, scripts are designed to always work across all variants, as it provides a various set of functions that fill the environment. 


## How come JULY is your choice? 
JULY offers a way to pack a range of environmental functions into the software you're currently using/have access to. 
This will enable everyone to exploit in ways never EVER seen before.


## Supporting JULY in your Software
As a software owner, integrating JULY into your system will have a smoother and accelerated experience for scripters, allowing them to to create scripts and work on scripts they provide for the community, it will be in such a way that their own products will work in a way that hasn't been possible since Synapse's discontinuation.

If you have or have already implemented JULYâ€™s features into your software, you can show this by adding our logo to your website, thread, or application.

You can find our logo here: https://imgur.com/a/BWeQa5X

This will inform the community of your unification in providing scripters an smoother and easier method of engineering scripts that your users can enjoy.

Notification: If you are a product owner and only have a part of the functionality and fucntions of JULY, you can still support JULY. Your contribution and mind are more valuable than just displaying our logo on your website.

## Having a look into your Environment

You can run the JULY Environment Checking Script to see how the expierence in your executor is and what Environmental Functions it does support.
You can find the script [here.](JULYEnvCheck.lua) The script will be notifying you on what Environment Function/Functions is/are missing, and writes the results to a file under workspace.
