# Joint Universal Labelling for You
aka JULY, is an organization provided for the soul purpose of a better unified scripting Environment for our users.

## JULY Has Officially been created ðŸ‘‹

Since UNC has retired, I as a fellow member of the Exploiting Community have decided to revive it for a better Environment for everyone, I will be giving out Tutorials if I have time.
I do not think this will be a hit like UNC, it may be difficult for me to conzentrate on multiple Projects at once, because of that, this will be a Small Project for now.

JULY will get Updates each Month I hope if I have time.
There will be documented Files containing on how to code Functions and Theory's on how to code some of them. (Since I do not own every Function in this Language.)

You can take a look inside the files of JULY, you may make your own Versions of this Project, I highly advice you to make your own Version of this Project with your own Theory's and work.

## What Purpose does it behold?
I have seen people struggle and take others work as their own just to be in a higher stand then them.

This is why, JULY has been created.
Its Purpose is to give people what they always wanted and needed the most.
A better Environment.

Not everyone has the Budget to get what they desire.
This is why we are a free and a nice community.
We do not want to take Scripters ability away to code.
We do not want them to take the long way to achieve the same energy.
We want to everyone to achieve cross compatibility.
The JULY will solve this issue using Joint Universal Labelling for you.

A script will always work in any variant of it with JULY Filling the Environment with Various of Functions. 

## How come JULY is your choice? 
The JULY provides a way to Pack Various Environment Functions into the Software you currenlty have access to.
Everyone will have access to Exploiting in a way no one has ever seen.


## Supporting JULY in your Software
As a Software Owner, your Work will have a smoother and faster experience for scripters, so they are able to work on scripts that they provide for the Community, their Products will work on a way no one has ever felt after Synapse's Discontinuation.
If you have Implemented JULY's Work into your Software, you can display so by adding our logo into your website, thread or application.

You can find our logo here: https://imgur.com/a/BWeQa5X

This will inform members of the Community of your Unification in providing scripters an smoother and easier method of engineering scripts that your users can enjoy.

Notification: if you are a Product Owner, and do not have all of the functions but you have a part of it, you may support JULY.
Your mind is more powerfull than the logo that you can display on your website.

## Having a look into your Environment

You can run the JULY Environment Checking Script to see how the expierence in your executor is and what Environmental Functions it does support.
You can find the script [here.](JULYEnvCheck.lua) The script will be notifying you on what Environment Function/Functions is/are missing, and writes the results to a file under workspace.
