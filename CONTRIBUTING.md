# Contributing

## The Guidelines
* Adding a new function can be done by copying TEMPLATE.md, renaming it, and editing it as needed.
* You may provide edits of existing functions, just edit and submit it.
* When possible, organise files in their respective category folders.
* When writing the function signature, please make sure it is **valid typed Luau syntax**. Documentation for typed luau can be found [here](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck#union-types).
* When referencing arguments of a function in the description, please use `` in order to make `it look nice like so`.
* Please confirm a function has not already been added to JULY before you submit it.

* Function Names should describe what the Function does
  * You can use anything as the name as long as it is Appropriate.
  * If you are adding a new alias, just make sure it is still readable and does describe what it does
    * Like `hookfunc`, as long as I see `func`, its okey, I understand it means hooking a func. (func is short for function)
    * Since many use Functions like: `hookfunc`, `detourfunction`, `replaceclosure`, `replacefunction` and etc, we cant just make the aliases for `hookfunction` not be in the JULY. Many already have implemented these aliases in their Scripts. So this is why JULY has it, and allows it.

* If the function is basic like `GetCurrentThread`, you can put `N/A` in the description of the function.
* Functions don't always require an alias, you can just write `N/A` in that field as well.
